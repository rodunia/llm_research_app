# Future: 5 products → 2,700 runs (5 products × 5 materials × 3 temps × 3 reps × 3 times × 4 engines)

# --- 3. LEGACY CONFIGURATIONS (ARCHIVED) ---
# NOTE: MODEL_CONFIGURATIONS, STANDARDIZED_PROMPTS, and get_model_config()
# were moved to archive/legacy_config.py on 2025-10-06.
#
# These were used by the deprecated interactive CLI (archive/main.py).
# The batch system uses ENGINE_MODELS (above) and Jinja2 templates (prompts/*.j2) instead.
#
# If you need these for reference, see: archive/legacy_config.py
